# SIGNAL_OWNERSHIP_REGISTRY_V1

Status: ACTIVE_GOVERNANCE_REGISTRY
Phase: 8C
Operation: OP-PHASE-8C-MEMORY-ARCHIVE-SIGNAL-GOVERNANCE-V1
Runtime effect: none

## Purpose

Provide a cross-domain ownership view for signal families. Domain-specific ownership registries remain the detailed source; this registry is the constitutional signal map.

## Coverage

Signal ownership coverage: 90%. Known runtime signal families have owners; unknown/future tool, recommendation, and aggregate lifecycle areas require Owner decisions before expansion.
